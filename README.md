- This is the SAS code of data processing, analyzing in my master's thesis "Credit Contagion via Intra- and Inter-Industry Network"
- My research has found empirical evidence of the effects of inter-industry credit contagion in default prediction, using the forward intensity approach of Duan et al. (2012).
- Previous literature has documented that value-relevant information (e.g. Market value of the firm, cash to total assets ratio) spreads out in financial markets, and the stocks in industries that have supplier and/or customer relationships cross-predict each other’s returns.
- I used the Exposure CoVaR of Adrian and Brunnermeire (2016) to measure the tail risk between a given firm and its economically related industries. (note: CoVaR is a concept and a measurement of correlated “Value at Risk” and does not refer to covariance)
- My empirical results show the significant contagion effect between defaulted firms and other firms belonging to the same industries.
